            Create a GitHub.com account and a repository that you will use for this class.

            Follow the Development Setup Video (beginning of Module 1) instructions on how
            to create a repository and set it up such that you can host and view your finished
            web pages on GitHub Pages, i.e., GitHub.io domain name. You will need to provide
            that URL for your peer review.


            For this assignment, you are to use Twitter Bootstrap CSS Framework as much as
            possible. I suggest you start with copying the starter bootstrap files and folders
            we discussed in Lecture 25 part 2. If you've cloned/downloaded the code example
            repository, it should be in the examples/Lecture25 folder. Copy the contents of
            examples/Lecture25 to your solution container folder (e.g., module3-solution) as a starting point..


            Desktop mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap md-based classes
            Tablet mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap sm-based classes
            Mobile mockup illustration should correspond to Bootstrap xs-based classes
            Navbar: Create a navbar that scrolls away together with the page (the navbar should
            become invisible and is not fixed to the top when you scroll the page down). The navbar
            should have a company name (i.e., navbar-brand class) called "Food, LLC" that is aligned
            to the left side of the navbar. (See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar. Make the
            browser window narrower to see the mobile menu button appear in the first example shown
            at the provided link.)
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <div class="menu-item">
          <a href="#" class="menu-title text-capitalize text-center">beef</a>
          <p>
            For desktop and tablet view, the navbar should not contain anything else. No other buttons should
            be visible. (Hint: use 'visible-xs' class.)

            Navbar - Mobile View: Create a simple menu button (3 horizontal bars). When the user clicks that
            button, a dropdown menu should appear (as illustrated in Mobile Open Menu illustration below.)
            The dropdown menu should contain 3 items: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

            The dropdown menu should take up the entire width of the browser window. Make sure the
            dropdown menu has a background color set that distinguishes it from the rest of the content.

            (Hint: See http://getbootstrap.com/components/#navbar and Lecture 31 for examples on how to accomplish this.)

            Page Heading. The page heading that says Our Menu should be centered within the browser window.
            You must use a Bootstrap class to accomplish this.

            (Hint: look for a Bootstrap class that centers text, see http://getbootstrap.com/css/#type-alignment.)

            Create a single really tall section that will use the Bootstrap Grid and take up the entire width of the
            browser window (minus some margins, of course) for all views: desktop, tablet, and mobile.
            To make the section really tall, you can either fill it out with a LOT of text or simply set its height
            to something like 1000px. It needs to be tall enough to cause scrolling down to be required to view
            the bottom of the section. Make sure its background color is set to distinguish it from the rest of the
            content. (Hint: don't forget to have an element with a class='container' or class='container-fluid' wrapping
            your grid. Remember that to have the grid do something "always", i.e., no matter what browser window
            size, use the col-xs-... classes. In this case, since we want the section to take up the entire row, use col-xs-12.)
            Here is what you will need to complete the assignment:
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>


      <div class="col-xs-12">
        <div class="menu-item">
          <a href="#" class="menu-title text-capitalize text-center">sushi</a>
          <p>

               that URL for your peer review.

              Create a folder in your repository that will serve as a container folder for your
              solution to this assignment. You can call it whatever you want. For example,
              module3-solution or mod3_solution, etc. Create an index.html file inside the
              solution container folder, e.g., module3-solution/index.html.
